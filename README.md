flask-auth-utils
================
This codebase holds the flask-auth-utils project, a standalone python module that provides an interface for
easily setting up authentication in a flask project. For an example of how this is used, see my
[stupidchess project](https://github.com/norwoodj/stupidchess-backend).

To build and upload this module:
```
make upload
```
